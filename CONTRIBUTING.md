## Making a PR

If you would like to contribute to the AngelSuite installer, please base your work on the
`main` branch, as this will be the most up-to-date starting point for you to
work from. We thank you for your contribution!

## Release Schedule

We do not have a fixed release schedule, and will release a new version once
changes are implemented. This process is not planned to change until at lease
version 1.0.0.
